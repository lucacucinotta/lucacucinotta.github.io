Hello, I'm Luca Cucinotta, a Web Developer and student at start2impact, and you're here for my Portfolio Website.

The building of this project born about "HTML & CSS" course by start2impact, where was asked to me of create an Portfolio Website.
## Website's Purpose and his structure
This website has the purpose to show to a potentially interested public my characteristics and what I can do, thanks to the skills and projects that are shown on the page respectively in "Skills" and "Portfolio" section.

In addition, you can find in my website a little presentaion of me next to my photo, in "About Me" section and a form to contact me for any reason, in the homonymous "Contact Me" section.
## Technologies used
For create this website I've used different technologies:
* List **Visual Studio Code** as editor for writing code; 
* List **HTML** for realized the page's structure, 
* List **Bootstrap**, a CSS's framework, for develop web interface and that I've also used to make the site 100% responsive thanks to breakpoints; 
* List **SASS**, a powerful professional grade CSS extension for the stylesheets;
* List **EmailJS** for receiving emails.
## Open Graph and SEO
To improve SEO, I finally introduced the Open Graph tag, that is a protocol that allows you to indicate to social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin for example, what information is shown when someone shares a link from your site.
